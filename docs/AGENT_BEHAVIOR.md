# Agent Behavior Guide

## Autonomous Loop

The agent runs a 24/7 heartbeat loop with the following schedule:

| Interval | Task | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Every 30 min | Heartbeat | State save, health check |
| Every 2 hours | Marketing | Generate and post content |
| Every 6 hours | Community | Forum engagement, replies |
| Every 12 hours | Submissions | Contest discovery, query letters |
| Every 24 hours | Library | Library outreach requests |
| Every 6 hours | Reflection | Self-improvement analysis |
| Daily at 3 UTC | Summary | Performance report |

## Content Generation

All content is generated by LLMs using the author profile and book catalog.
The system varies:
- **Platform format** (short for Bluesky, long for blogs)
- **Tone** (intellectual, emotional, provocative)
- **Book selection** (weighted toward recent releases)
- **Approach** (direct promotion vs. community engagement)

## Self-Improvement

The Strategy Reflector analyzes:
- Which content gets engagement
- Which platforms perform best
- Error patterns and recovery
- Timing optimization

It generates new strategies every 6 hours and stores them in persistent memory.

## Safety Measures

- All API keys stored in environment variables only
- Rate limiting respects platform ToS
- Content is generated fresh (never copied)
- Dry-run mode available for testing
- Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
